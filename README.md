# Alex' Todo page

## A page to create and complete a list of todos.

This page is designed to create a list of activities or actions to be carried out in an order or randomly.

* In the HTML doc, a heading was ceated using the h1 element inside a header tag. A form was implemented in which an input element was added which had a button, then a select element for filtering the todo list was added. After the form, the todo list container followed which has an empty todo list un-ordered list  item.

* Inside the CSS file, the body was styled with a linear-gradient background-color and font used was Poppins. The form, input, buttons and dropdown select elements were styled.

* Event listeners were added to the todo input, todo button, filter todo and todo list. Function to create todo was implemented as well as the function to delete todos and function to display completed todos in a crossed-out text format. CSS stylings for the delete todo buttons and completed todos were carried out inside the javaScript file.

## How to use:

* Type in a task -say, "Learn HTML"- into the input area.
* Click on the "+" button on press enter.
* When you go on and complete the task, you can click on the green-tick button.
* Clicking on the green-tick button crosses out the task.
* Clicking on the trash button on a task removes the task from the list.
* If a todo list has uncompleted and completed task, the tasks on display can be filtered with the dropdown select button just beside the input area.
