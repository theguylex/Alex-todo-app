# Alex' Todo page

## A page to create and complete a list of todos.

This page is designed to create a list of activities or actions to be carried out in an order or randomly.

*In the HTML doc, a heading was ceated using the h1 element inside a header tag. A form was implemented in which an input element was added which had a button, then a select element for filtering the todo list was added. After the form, the todo list container followed which has an empty todo list un-ordered list  item.

*Inside the CSS file, the body was styled with a linear-gradient background-color and font used was Poppins. The form, input, buttons and dropdown select elements were styled.

Event liseners were added to the todo input, todo button, filter todo and todo list. Function to create todo was implemented as well as the function to delete todos and function to display completed todos in a crossed-out text format. CSS stylings for the delete todo buttons and completed todos were carried out inside the javaScript file.
